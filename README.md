# ShadowFox Summer Internship Projects
Welcome to the repository for my summer internship projects! During my virtual internship at ShadowFox, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks that allowed me to apply my skills and learn new ones. This repository contains the code and documentation for the projects I worked on.

# Project Overview

This repository contains the projects I completed during my virtual internship at ShadowFox. These projects involved a mix of applying my existing skills and learning new ones. The tasks were completed independently, without direct guidance from the team, which provided a unique opportunity to grow professionally.

# Project Details

**Task 1:** Boston House Price Prediction
Description: Housing data is used in csv format. The data has various attributes like CRIM, ZN, INDUS, and many more and the prediction is made on MEDV (Median value of owner - occupied homes in 1000s)

**Skills Applied:**
- Data Preprocessesing
- Feature Selection
- Feature Scaling
- Detecting Outliers
- Training The Data
- ML Algorithms for Prediction. (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressors, Gradient Boosting Regressor)
- Evaluation Metrics and Comparison
- Prediction with the Best Algorithm (Gradient Boosting Regressor)

**Libraries Used:**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- warnings
  
**Task 2:** Car Selling Price Predictor
Description: Car data is used. The data has attributes such as Car_Name, Year, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, and many more with Selling_Price being the target value. With the use of this data, the selling price of the cars is predicted.

**Skills Applied:**
- Data Preprocessesing
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis
- Detecting and Handling Outliers
- One Hot Encoder
- Training The Data
- ML Algorithm (Random Forest Regressor)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Randomized Search CV)
- Prediction with the Best Parameters
- Evaluation Metrics
- App (takes the user input as the raw data and predicts)

**Libraries Used:**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tkinter
